This warm-up task was made on student internship in SoftwareHut company. We could not use JS, so it is just CSS and HTML on desktop and mobile phones versions. I have learned SCSS and BEM while doing this project. You can see it here: https://maciej-sokolowski.github.io/SoftwareHut--praktyki-2019/.
